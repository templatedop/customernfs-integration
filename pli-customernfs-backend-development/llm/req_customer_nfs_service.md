# Customer NFS (Non-Financial Service) Microservice — Requirements

**Service Name:** Customer NFS Service (customer-nfs-service)
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** February 2026
**Status:** Draft
**Skills Used:** insurance-planner, insurance-analyst, insurance-architect

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The Customer NFS Service is a **dedicated microservice** responsible for orchestrating non-financial service requests that modify **customer master data**. It owns the workflow lifecycle (request creation, document collection, approval routing, execution) but delegates the actual data mutation to Customer Core Service via Temporal activities.

This service handles only customer-boundary changes. Policy-level NFS (nominee change, agent change, duplicate bond, refund of premium) belongs to their respective domain services.

### Scope Boundary

| In Scope (Customer NFS) | Out of Scope (Other Services) |
|---|---|
| Address Change (Aadhaar + Manual) | Agent Change → Policy Service |
| Name Change (Aadhaar + Manual) | Nominee Change → Policy Service |
| Withdrawal of customer NFS requests | Duplicate Policy Bond → Policy Service |
| Missing document collection for customer NFS | Refund of Premium → Billing Service |
| Service request lifecycle (create/track/approve) | Premium Receipt Book → Billing Service |
| Audit trail for all customer NFS operations | Communication dispatch → Notification Service |

### Why a Separate Microservice?

Customer Core Service is a **pure data service** — thin Temporal workflows wrapping CRUD activities, sub-millisecond response times, no business orchestration. NFS requests are the opposite: long-running workflows (15–30 day approval cycles), human-in-the-loop approvals, document collection with external links, multi-step maker-checker patterns, and Aadhaar OTP integration. Mixing these concerns into Customer Core would violate its design principle of being a fast, stateless data service.

The NFS Service **calls** Customer Core (via Temporal `ExecuteChildWorkflow`) to persist approved changes. It never writes directly to `customer_db`.

### Key Architectural Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Separate DB (`nfs_db`) from `customer_db` | NFS data (requests, approvals, documents) has different lifecycle, retention, and query patterns than customer master data |
| Temporal workflows for all NFS processing | Long-running (days/weeks), needs human-in-the-loop, compensation on failure, state persistence |
| Calls Customer Core/Profile for data mutation | Single writer principle — Customer Core owns customer writes. NFS orchestrates, Core persists |
| Aadhaar verification via KYC Service | Reuse existing UIDAI integration. NFS does not talk to UIDAI directly |
| Event-driven downstream notification | Publishes events; Notification Service, Policy Service, and others consume as needed |

## 3. Functional Requirements

### FR-NFS-001: Address Change via Aadhaar Authentication (Immediate)

- **Priority:** High
- **Description:** Customer initiates address change with Aadhaar OTP. On successful verification, the address fetched from UIDAI becomes the new address. No manual approval needed — change completes immediately.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Customer provides customer_id, policy_number, Aadhaar number, and change type
  2. System sends OTP request to KYC Service → UIDAI
  3. Customer submits OTP; KYC Service verifies and returns Aadhaar address data
  4. If verified: NFS Service calls Customer Profile Service (`UpdateAddressActivity`) with new address from UIDAI
  5. Old address version marked `is_active=false`, new version created (address versioning per BR-CUST-009)
  6. Service request status set to COMPLETED immediately
  7. Events published: `customer.address.updated`, `nfr.request.completed`
  8. Acknowledgment receipt generated (PDF with ticket number)
  9. SMS/Email notification sent to customer

### FR-NFS-002: Address Change via Manual Document Upload (Approval Workflow)

- **Priority:** High
- **Description:** When Aadhaar-based change is not possible (customer choice, Aadhaar unavailable, address mismatch), customer submits supporting documents. CPC user reviews and approves/rejects.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Customer submits: customer_id, policy_number, new address fields, document uploads (Address Proof, Rental Agreement, Application Form)
  2. System creates service request with status PENDING_APPROVAL
  3. Service request assigned to CPC user at customer's servicing office
  4. CPC user can: Approve, Reject, Send Back for Corrections, or Request Missing Documents
  5. On Approve: NFS Service calls Customer Profile Service (`UpdateAddressActivity`); status → COMPLETED
  6. On Reject: reason recorded; customer notified; status → REJECTED
  7. On Request Missing Documents: triggers Missing Document sub-workflow (FR-NFS-009)
  8. Approval timeline: 15–30 business days
  9. SLA monitoring with escalation if approval exceeds timeline

### FR-NFS-003: Address Change for Multiple Roles

- **Priority:** Medium
- **Description:** Address change supports updating address for different roles on the policy: Insured, Proposer, Assignee, Trustee. Each role may have different addresses.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. `address_update_for` field supports: INSURED, PROPOSER, ASSIGNEE, TRUSTEE
  2. `address_type` field supports: COMMUNICATION, PERMANENT, OFFICIAL
  3. If role is INSURED, address propagates to customer master record
  4. If role is PROPOSER/ASSIGNEE/TRUSTEE, address stored as policy-level address (delegated to Policy Service)
  5. Only INSURED address changes are processed by this service; other roles forwarded to Policy Service

### FR-NFS-004: Name Change via Aadhaar Authentication (Immediate)

- **Priority:** High
- **Description:** Customer initiates name change with Aadhaar OTP. On successful verification, the name from UIDAI becomes the authoritative name. No manual approval needed.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Customer provides customer_id, policy_number, Aadhaar number
  2. OTP verification via KYC Service → UIDAI
  3. If verified: extract salutation, first_name, middle_name, last_name from UIDAI response
  4. NFS Service calls Customer Core Service (`UpdateIdentityActivity`) with new name fields
  5. Old name preserved in audit history (name_change_history table)
  6. **Name reflects across all linked policies** — event `customer.name.updated` published with `policies_affected` count
  7. Policy Service consumes event and updates policy records (policyholder name on bonds)
  8. Service request status set to COMPLETED immediately
  9. DOB remains immutable — name change does NOT alter DOB (BR-CUST-005)
- **Source:** FS_ANC_007, FS_ANC_008, FS_ANC_009 [`Non-Financial_Service_SRS_NFR_Address_Change_Name_Change.md`]

### FR-NFS-005: Name Change via Manual Document Upload (Approval Workflow)

### FR-NFS-009: Missing Document Collection Sub-Workflow

- **Priority:** Medium
- **Description:** When CPC user identifies missing documents during NFS review, system sends secure upload link to customer and tracks submission.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. CPC user selects missing document types from predefined list per NFS type
  2. System generates time-limited secure upload URL (configurable expiry, default 7 days)
  3. Notification sent to customer via SMS/Email/WhatsApp with upload link and instructions
  4. Customer uploads documents via link or submits physically at Post Office
  5. Physical submission: Post Office staff indexes document against Missing Document Request ID
  6. On document receipt: CPC user notified; request status moves from PENDING_DOCUMENTS → PENDING_APPROVAL
  7. If link expires without submission: reminder sent, new link generated (up to 3 attempts)
  8. After 3 expired links: request auto-closed with status DOCUMENTS_EXPIRED
  9. Previously raised missing document requests visible in a status table

    OTP --> VerifyOTP[Customer enters OTP<br>Signal: otp_submitted]
    VerifyOTP --> VerifyResult{KYC Service<br>verifies OTP}
    VerifyResult -->|Failure| RetryOTP{Retries < 3?}
    RetryOTP -->|Yes| OTP
    RetryOTP -->|No| FallbackManual[Convert to Manual path<br>status → PENDING_APPROVAL]
    VerifyResult -->|Success| ExtractAddr[Extract address<br>from UIDAI response]
    ExtractAddr --> UpdateProfile[Call Customer Profile Service<br>UpdateAddressActivity]
    UpdateProfile --> CreateAudit[CreateAuditLogActivity]
    CreateAudit --> PublishEvent[Publish Events<br>customer.address.updated<br>nfr.request.completed]
    PublishEvent --> GenerateReceipt[GenerateAckReceiptActivity]
    GenerateReceipt --> Notify[Publish nfr.notification.send]
    Notify --> Complete([COMPLETED])
```

**Temporal Configuration:**
- Workflow ID: `nfs-address-aadhaar-{request_id}`
- Task Queue: `customer-nfs-tq`
- Execution Timeout: 10 minutes (OTP timeout)
- Signal: `otp_submitted` (customer enters OTP)

### Workflow 2: Address Change — Manual Approval Path

```mermaid
graph TB
    Start([Customer submits<br>address change + docs]) --> Validate[ValidateRequestActivity]
    Validate -->|Invalid| Error1([Validation error])
    Validate -->|Valid| CreateSR[CreateServiceRequestActivity<br>status = PENDING_APPROVAL]
    CreateSR --> StoreDoc[StoreDocumentsActivity<br>Upload to DMS]

```

**Temporal Configuration:**
- Workflow ID: `nfs-address-manual-{request_id}`
- Task Queue: `customer-nfs-tq`
- Execution Timeout: 45 days (30 day approval + 15 day buffer)
- Signals: `approval_decision`, `docs_received`, `withdraw_request`
- Queries: `get_status`, `get_request_detail`

### Workflow 3: Name Change — Aadhaar Path

Identical structure to Workflow 1 but calls `UpdateIdentityActivity` on Customer Core Service instead of `UpdateAddressActivity` on Profile Service. Additionally publishes `customer.name.updated` with `policies_affected` count. Policy Service consumes event to update policy records.

**Temporal Configuration:**
- Workflow ID: `nfs-name-aadhaar-{request_id}`
- Task Queue: `customer-nfs-tq`
- Execution Timeout: 10 minutes

### Workflow 4: Name Change — Manual Approval Path

Identical structure to Workflow 2 but:
- Required documents: Gazette Notification / Newspaper Notification / Name Change Form
- On approval: calls `UpdateIdentityActivity` on Customer Core (name fields only, DOB immutable)
- Publishes `customer.name.updated` with `policies_affected` count
- Policy Service consumes event to update all linked policy records

**Temporal Configuration:**
- Workflow ID: `nfs-name-manual-{request_id}`
- Task Queue: `customer-nfs-tq`
- Execution Timeout: 45 days

### Workflow 5: NFS Request Withdrawal

```mermaid
graph TB
    Start([Customer requests<br>withdrawal]) --> CheckElig[CheckWithdrawalEligibilityActivity<br>status ∈ CREATED/PENDING_DOCS/PENDING_APPROVAL]
    CheckElig -->|Not Eligible| Error([Cannot withdraw])

## 13. Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-NFS-001: Performance

| Metric | Target | Context |
|---|---|---|
| Aadhaar address/name change (happy path) | < 15 seconds p95 | OTP verification + data update |
| Service request creation (manual path) | < 500ms p95 | Request creation + document upload initiation |
| CPC approval action | < 200ms p95 | Signal delivery to workflow |
| Request status query | < 50ms p95 | Single row read by request_id |
| Dashboard query (pending requests) | < 500ms p95 | Indexed queries with aggregation |

### NFR-NFS-002: Concurrency

| Config | Value | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| MaxConcurrentActivityExecutionSize | 50 | Moderate — mostly waiting on signals |
| MaxConcurrentWorkflowTaskExecutionSize | 100 | Many long-running workflows in parallel |
| WorkerActivitiesPerSecond | 200 | Rate limit to protect downstream services |
| PostgreSQL connection pool | 20 | NFS is not read-heavy like Core |

### NFR-NFS-003: Security

- All APIs authenticated via JWT
- CPC actions require CPC staff role (RBAC)
- Customer can only view/withdraw their own requests
- Aadhaar data never persisted in nfs_db (processed in-memory via KYC Service)
- Document uploads scanned for malware before storage
- Secure upload links: time-limited, single-use, cryptographically signed tokens

### NFR-NFS-004: Availability

- NFS workers: minimum 2 replicas
- REST API: minimum 2 replicas behind load balancer
- PostgreSQL: primary + standby with streaming replication
- RTO: < 10 minutes (NFS is not as latency-critical as Core)
- Long-running workflows survive service restarts (Temporal persistence)

### NFR-NFS-005: Data Retention

- Service requests: retained 10 years minimum (regulatory compliance)
- Audit logs: retained 10 years minimum, partitioned yearly
- Documents: retained in DMS per DMS retention policy (10 years)
- Completed/rejected requests: soft-archived after 1 year (queryable but moved to cold storage)

## 17. Assumptions and Constraints

### Assumptions

| # | Assumption |
|---|---|
| A1 | Customer NFS Service is the ONLY writer to nfs_db. No other service has direct DB access. |
| A2 | Customer NFS Service does NOT write to customer_db. All customer data mutations go through Customer Core/Profile services via Temporal. |
| A3 | KYC Service handles all Aadhaar/UIDAI communication. NFS Service calls KYC, never UIDAI directly. |
| A4 | Policy Service is responsible for updating policy records when it consumes `customer.address.updated` / `customer.name.updated` events. NFS Service does not update policy records. |
| A5 | Only INSURED role address changes are processed by this service. PROPOSER/ASSIGNEE/TRUSTEE address changes are Policy Service responsibility. |
| A6 | Notification dispatch is handled by Notification Service consuming events. NFS Service does not send SMS/Email directly. |
| A7 | Document Management Service (DMS) handles storage, virus scanning, and retention of uploaded documents. |

### Constraints

| # | Constraint |
|---|---|
| C1 | Aadhaar auto-approval is limited to Portal and Mobile channels due to post-office accountability requirements. |
| C2 | Maximum 3 missing document link generations per request. |
| C3 | File uploads limited to 5 MB per file, PDF/JPEG/PNG only. |
| C4 | Audit logs cannot be modified or deleted — INSERT-only table. |
| C5 | DOB cannot be changed via name change workflow — requires separate PLI Directorate process. |

## 18. Open Questions

| # | Question | Impact | Proposed Answer |
|---|---|---|---|
| OQ-NFS-001 | Should name change for minor policyholder require guardian approval? | Workflow logic | Propose: Yes, add guardian consent step |
| OQ-NFS-002 | Can a customer have concurrent address AND name change requests? | Duplicate check logic | Propose: Yes, they are different types — allow concurrent |
| OQ-NFS-003 | Is there a fee for manual name/address change? | Business rules | Propose: No fee for address/name; fee only for Duplicate Policy Bond |
| OQ-NFS-004 | Should CPC approval be maker-checker (two-person) or single approver? | Workflow complexity | Propose: Single approver for NFS; maker-checker for financial operations only |
| OQ-NFS-005 | What is the exact SLA for address/name change at each office tier? | SLA configuration | Propose: 15 business days for Regional, 30 for Circle HQ. Needs stakeholder confirmation. |
